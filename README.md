Here it is, how using basic C language, we can create a library management system, there is a demo code for it, even if we use basic code in it, its management is very advanced.

You are getting free storage for book storage, which will store your list of books for a long time without any specific limit.

You can create any other management system using them. Hope to benefit from it, thanks
