Here it is, how using basic C language, we can create a library management system, there is a demo code for it, even if we use basic code in it, its management is very advanced.

# Library Management System

A simple C-based Library Management System using file handling to manage books and student-issued records. It allows you to add, remove, and list books and issue books to students.

## Features
- **Add Book**: Add a new book with ID, name, author, and date.
- **List Books**: View all available books.
- **Remove Book**: Delete a book by ID.
- **Issue Book**: Issue a book to a student, recording student details.
- **Issued Book List**: View all issued books with student information.

## Setup
1. **Clone**: `git clone https://github.com/jaber10000/LibraryManagementSystem.git`
2. **Compile**: `gcc library_management_system.c -o library_management_system`
3. **Run**: `./library_management_system`

## Usage
- Select options from the menu:
  - `1` to add a book.
  - `2` to list books.
  - `3` to remove a book.
  - `4` to issue a book.
  - `5` to view issued books.
  - `0` to exit.

### Data Files
- **books.txt**: Stores book information.
- **issue.txt**: Stores issued book records.



You are getting free storage for book storage, which will store your list of books for a long time without any specific limit.

You can create any other management system using them. Hope to benefit from it, thanks
